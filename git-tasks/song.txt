Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battlefield
Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We're marching into destiny

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!
Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear
Hold the lines, move as one
In unity our victory's won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall
