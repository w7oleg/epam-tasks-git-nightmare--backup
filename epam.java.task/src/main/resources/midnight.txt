Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory
She is smiling alone
In the lamplight
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan

All alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beautiful then
I remember the time
I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
