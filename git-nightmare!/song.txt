Fear will not pierce our hearts
Though swords and arrows will
Victory is our reward
For all the blood we spill
We didn't come to waste our lives
Like pawns in a savage game
Our spirits, spears and shields are linked
In a much stronger chain

March as one
Don't look back
Oden's sons
Attack!

All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
All are one and one is all
Shield by shield we'll never fall
All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
